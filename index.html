                Instead of publishing a dump of time schedules or a full fletched route planner, Linked Connections puts forward a publishing mechanism that gives clients access to the data ready to be used by a route planning algorithm.
                It uses departure-arrival pairs from a station to another (a connection), and orders these connections by departure time.
                It then fragments this dataset in documents that can be published over HTTP as illustrated in the figure below.
                Links in the responses ensure a client can always find more information to take into account.
